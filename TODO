1. Disable kexec reboots. Go to etc/default/kexec and set to false. 
2. Add Trolltech.conf file to ~/.config/ directory in Ubuntu. 
3. Find new hosting option. Dropbox how has a 3 GB limit. 
4. Add 'live-config' to the end of the isolinux.cfg so that the live session will not lock when left idle. 
5. Add .vimrc file to root. This is more for my convenience.  
6. Leave RTXI folder in /home/ that has global access permissions.
