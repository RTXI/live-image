###Live Image

**Requirements:** live-build, live-config, debbootstrap, xorriso, a compiled RT kernel, and an installed RTXI application  
**Limitations:** You'll have to get your hands dirty. [Documentation Here](http://live.debian.net/manual/3.x/html/live-manual.en.html)  

These build scripts are designed to generate an up-to-date RTXI live image. It's what we use to generate the image available on [our website](http://rtxi.org/install/). 

**Main features:**  
I'll add this when everything's working.



**Update (1/2/2014):**
Aah, the live stuff's going to take a bit to explain...another day.  

Just don't run remaster-script.sh. It's more of a copy/paste line-by-line thing. Running it will only cause you sadness.  

Also, you can't install from the live environment. Reboot and choose "install" or "graphical install" from the menu.
