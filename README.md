###Live Image

**Requirements:** live-build, live-config, debbootstrap, xorriso, a compiled RT kernel, and an installed RTXI application
**Limitations:** You'll have to get your hands dirty. [Documentation Here](http://live.debian.net/manual/3.x/html/live-manual.en.html)

These build scripts are designed to generate an up-to-date RTXI live image. It's what we use to generate the image available on [our website](http://rtxi.org/install/). 

**Main features:**  
1. **Builds Debian Jessie** - it's in testing (as of 12/16/14), but it's packages are frozen. Sources are given as "jessie" and not "testing", so no changes are needed when jessie gets pushed to stable.  
2. **Cinnamon desktop** - I like cinnamon more than gnome.
